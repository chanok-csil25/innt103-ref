Exception Thrown in method3

method3 throws a new Exception.
Since method3 does not catch the exception, it propagates up to method2.
Exception Propagates to method2

method2 also does not handle the exception.
It has throws Exception in its signature, so the exception is propagated up to method1.
Exception Propagates to method1

method1 also does not handle the exception.
It has throws Exception in its signature, so the exception is propagated up to the main method.
Exception Caught in main Method

The main method has a try-catch block.
The propagated exception is caught here, and a message is printed.
